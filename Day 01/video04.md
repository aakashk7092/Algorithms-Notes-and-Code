# Algorithms — Day 01 (Video 04)

## Topic  
**How to Analyze an Algorithm**

This session introduced the different factors involved in analyzing the performance and efficiency of an algorithm. The focus was on understanding that algorithm analysis is not limited to just time complexity, but also includes several system-level considerations.

## Factors in Algorithm Analysis

An algorithm can be analyzed based on the following aspects:

### 1. Time  
Measures how long an algorithm takes to execute as input size grows.  
This leads to the study of **time complexity**.

### 2. Space  
Measures how much memory an algorithm consumes during execution.  
This leads to the study of **space complexity**.

### 3. Network (N/W)  
Considers the effect of **data transfer and communication cost**, especially in distributed systems and network-based applications.

### 4. Power  
Refers to the **energy consumption** of an algorithm or program.  
This is especially important in mobile devices and embedded systems.

### 5. CPU Registers  
Considers how efficiently an algorithm uses **processor resources**, such as registers and cache, which directly impacts performance at the hardware level.

## Key Learnings

- Algorithm analysis goes beyond just time and space.  
- Real-world efficiency also depends on **hardware, power usage, and system resources**.  
- For most theoretical studies, **time and space** are the primary focus.  
- For real-world applications, **network cost and power efficiency** become equally important.

## Personal Understanding

> “A truly efficient algorithm is not only fast in theory, but also practical in real-world environments.”

From now on, I will:
- Focus first on **time and space complexity**.  
- Then consider **system-level factors** when implementing real applications.
