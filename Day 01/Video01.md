## Topic  
**Understanding the Difference Between an Algorithm and a Program**

This document captures my learnings from the first video of my Algorithms playlist.  
The objective of this session was to clearly understand the roles of **algorithms** and **programs** in the software development process.

## Algorithm

An **algorithm** is a well-defined sequence of logical steps designed to solve a problem.

It primarily focuses on:
- Problem **design and planning**
- Use of **domain knowledge**
- Being **independent of any programming language**
- Consideration of **hardware and operating system constraints**
- **Analysis** of correctness and efficiency before implementation

In essence, an algorithm represents the **thinking and reasoning** behind a solution.

## Program

A **program** is the practical implementation of an algorithm using a specific programming language.

It involves:
- **Implementation** of logic
- Written and maintained by a **programmer**
- Dependency on a chosen **programming language**
- Execution on a particular **hardware and OS environment**
- Proper **testing** to ensure correctness

In essence, a program represents the **execution of logic** in a real system.

## Relationship Between Algorithm and Program

| Algorithm | Program |
|-----------|---------|
| Focuses on design and logic | Focuses on implementation |
| Language independent | Language dependent |
| Defines the solution approach | Executes the solution |
| Requires analysis | Requires testing |

**Typical Flow:**  
Problem → Algorithm Design → Program Implementation → Testing → Final Solution

## Key Learnings

- Every efficient solution begins with a **well-designed algorithm**.  
- Writing code without clear logic leads to inefficiency and errors.  
- Algorithms are **universal concepts**, whereas programs are **technology-specific implementations**.  
- Strong software development depends on both **clear thinking** and **correct execution**.

## Personal Takeaway

> “An algorithm builds the foundation of a solution; a program brings that solution to life.”

From now on, my approach will always be:
1. Design the algorithm first.  
2. Analyze its correctness and efficiency.  
3. Implement it in code.  
4. Test and refine the solution.
